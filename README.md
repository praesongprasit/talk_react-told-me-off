# Not accessible - React told me off!

This 20mins talk was prepared for:
- [A11y Camp](https://a11ycamp.org.au/) - 10th November 2022

I’m an engineer who cares about HTML output. I still make mistakes.

Often, front-end frameworks like React and Angular abstract HTML away. Even more so with design systems built on these frameworks. It’s easy to forget to scrutinise the output during implementation.

The good news is, these frameworks are aware of the problem, and are constantly getting better at catching low-hanging fruit.

Let me show you a few ways React and React Testing Library told me off!
