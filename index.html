Often, front-end frameworks like React and Angular abstract HTML away. Even more so with design systems built on these frameworks. It's easy to forget to scrutinise the output during implementation.
The good news is, these frameworks are aware of the problem, and are constantly getting better at catching low-hanging fruit.
Let me show you a few ways React and React Testing Library told me off!" />

						<p>Hi, I'm Prae, a Thai female with short dark hair. I'm wearing a big pair of dark framed glasses, and  [clothes].</p>
						<p>And I'm here to explain how React told me off, for writting inaccessible code.</p>
						<p>I'm a software engineer who cares about HTML output, and host of the Web Access Club podcast.</p>
						<p>I started my career in web as a junior designer.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Within the first month, I realised that I didn't enjoy designing, but I sure enjoyed coding up people's designs with HTML and CSS. So I've been a front-end person ever since.</p>
						<p>I love creating responsive designs and improving usability of designs through code. I was mainly working on large information heavy sites for many years, so using HTML, CSS and a little touch of JavaScript was enough.</p>
						<p>That is how I've managed to avoid learning to code in modern JavaScript frameworks like React for most of my career.</p>
						<p>Majority of my previous projects focused on templating informative pages (like tourism websites), my testing knowledge only extends to manual multi-device regression testing, and network throttling in the browser to check site performance.</p>
						<p>Since my code is usually concerned with visuals, in a fixed budget fast-pace agency environment, I didn't know, or needed to know how to write tests for my front-end code.</p>

					<h2>Why test code?</h2>
					<p>
						Reduce errors on complex interactive sites
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>This all changed, when I joined a team who works on a highly interactive web app, which was coded using React JavaScript framework.</p>
						<p>It was also when my job title changed from a developer to an engineer.</p>
						<p>Wow that was imposter syndrome inducing. I'm now expected to be able to 'engineer' websites, rather than simply 'develop' them.</p>
						<p>Suddenly, I'm not just making content available on a static page for my users.</p>
						<p>I'm providing users with different kinds of interactive elements, which let users do a lot more complex things on the page.</p>
						<p>So I have to learn to write tests to prevent and spot errors before customers sees it.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Think of to-do apps. It looks simple, a list title with lists of items.</p>
						<p>But there's a lot more to it than you think. I have to allow users to add whatever text they want as a dismissable list item.</p>
						<p>There's logic to control when a list item should be displayed, when it should appear in the 'done' or an 'archived' state, and when it should be permanently deleted. </p>
						<p>With so much microinteraction and power in the hands of my users, a lot more code could go wrong here. </p>
						<p>If I didn't code the list logic properly, archiving a list item could permanently delete that item by accident.</p>
						<p>And what happens, if someone uses a special character?</p>
						<p>Many JavaScript frameworks like React are designed, so that this sort of complex logic can be done in the browser, without forcing the users to refresh their browser. </p>
						<p>In the early days of the web, most logic that deals with content happens in the server, not the browser. </p>
						<p>So back-end developers who often use traditional imperative programming languages are expected to write tests, to ensure that the logic works as expected under different scenarios. It's good code quality control and development practice.</p>
						<p>But writing logical tests for front-end web interfaces is a much newer concept, especially for me. </p>
						<p>The first unit testing tool I've ever used was the React version of the open source library, called the 'Testing Library'.</p>

					<h2>React <br>Testing Library</h2>
					<p>Enforce user centric tests</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>This testing library can be added to many front-end frameworks.</p>
						<p>But since I'm working with React, I only know how to use it with React at the moment.</p>
						<p>The Testing Library helps me test UI components in a user-centric way, like the way a user would use a component.</p>

						<code data-trim data-noescape class="language-html">
							&lt;Button
								label="Add a new fish"
								onClick="this.showFishInput"
							/&gt;
							
							&lt;Input
								aria-label="Fish name"
								class="fishInput"
							/&gt;
							<span class="fragment">
							fireEvent.showFishInput()

							expect(&lt;Input class="fishInput"/&gt;) to render 🤯
							</span>
						</code>
					</pre>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>For example, I was tasked to write tests for a button that would show an input field.</p>
						<p>On the screen, you can see React Button markup, with label 'add a new fish' and an onClick handler, <br>which will run showFishInput that renders </p>
						<p>Below the button, is input code it suppose to render.</p>
						<p>The input field was marked up with aria-label 'Fish name', and class called 'fishInput'.</p>
						<p>A note that in this example, the function's syntax isn't entirely accurate, <br>and Input field doesn't have a visible label... and used aria-label.... I've only done that to simplified the slide.</p>
						<p>Please get correct syntax from docs, <br>and add a visible label then link it to input using for and ID attribute instead!!</p>
						<hr>
						<p>Anyway...</p>
						<p>In the past, the back-end style of writing tests, would focus on testing the function and implementation itself. In this case, the test would:</p>
						<p>Fire event called showFishInput, and expect an input with class called 'fishInput' to render</p>
						<p>The problem I have with this, is that it only tests if the input field with a class name "fishInput" appears on the page when that code is executed. The test doesn't care if there's an accessible name called "Fish name" attached to that newly rendered input field.</p>
						<p>That's not how users think about this interface.</p>
						<p>Users don't care about a classname? CSS classes are not visible to users on the page; their screen reader won't read it, and voice dictation tools can't find an element using CSS class.</p>
						<p>This, is how you'd write it in React Testing Library</p>

						</code>
					</pre>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>userEvent "Add a new fish" was clicked.</p>
						<p>The test expect an input field with an accessible name called "Fish name" to appear.</p>
						<p>React Testing Library is accessibility-first like that.</p>
						<p>It encourages engineers to write tests that queries accessible names and DOM roles, rather than arbitrary IDs and Classes that users don't care about.</p>
						<p>In this example, I used getByRole to find the input field.</p>
						<p>But you can query or find things in the DOM by other useful static things like ByTitle, ByAltText, ByDisplayValue, even interactive states like pressed, checked, selected.</p>
						<p>This is fantastic, because if the test cannot access those values, then something is seriously inaccessible about your code.</p>
						<p>I once spotted an issue, where a hidden attribute accidentally remained attached to a component that should be displaying.</p>
						<p>The query told me there's a problem because it couldn't find this hidden text.</p>

					<h2>What about React?</h2>
					<p>Improved docs, <br>development assistance, &amp; bundling</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I talked quite a bit about the React version of Testing Library.</p>
						<p>But as the name suggests, it's a library. Something designed to be used in conjunction with a framework. It's not React itself.</p>
						<p>So what does React itself actually do to help nudge engineers to write more accessible code?</p>
						<p>It ries to improve its docs, and recommend more development assistance, &amp; bundle those recommendations in their starter kit.</p>
						<hr>
						<p>With documentation,</p>
						<p>React understand that beginners copy and paste code quite blindly when learning.</p>
						<p>So their copy-paste examples all throughout their docs are getting better, and more accessibility conscious all the time.</p>
						<p>That is of course, human intervention. Requires reading. What about machine intervention?</p>
						<p>Well, is to recommend basic development assistance</p>

							&lt;button tabindex="2"&gt;
								Add a new fish
							&lt;/button&gt;

							(tabindex):
							Ensures tabindex attribute values
							are not greater than 0
						</code>
					</pre>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Everyone makes mistakes. Whenever possible, let tools instead of people tell them off.</p>
						<p>There are some basic accessibility linting tools like axe-linter or eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y.</p>
						<p>It would highlight an HTML attribute that isn't right, or is missing for a specific type of element with a red squiggly line like when you made a typo, and would show warnings in the console.</p>
						<p>The example on the screen, shows linting messages for image and a button called Add a new fish with tabindex 2.</p>
						<p>The linting message said:</p>
						<p>that the image needed an alternative text or a role of non or presentation</p>
						<p>For the button, it said that tabindex value should be no greater than 0.</p>
						<p>This is a great way to remind engineers basic things while they're coding.</p>

						<p>React understand that it's crucial to add best practices to starter kits, because that's usually how someone create their first React project.</p>

					<h2>People can <br>ignore tests?!</h2>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						Yes... but you can make it harder
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>But wait… this is real life. Can't people also just ignore or by-pass these tests?</p>
						<p>[Next]</p>
						<p>Yes, and no. Depends.</p>
						<p>For React Testing Library, if you don't write any tests as a part of your usual development process, then of course you won't reap these benefits.</p>

					<h2>Bake it in</h2>
					<p>
						TDD, prevent commits &amp; stop deploys
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>But if your team does test driven development, where you write tests first, then write real code which would fix the test, then React Testing Library will slot right into your workflow </p>
						<p>As for development assistance like linting… You <em>can</em> turn some linting tools off, like additional libraries or extensions attached to your code editor. And frustratingly, many engineers unfamiliar with front-end landscape do. So engineers could simply ignore many linting warnings.</p>
						<p>You can put in the last resort, of making sure that people cannot deploy code without passing accessibility tests and or linters.</p>
						<p>You can chain accessibility linter to the same test command you use before committing, pushing locally, and during build to deploy.</p>
						<p>If the tests fail, then the engineers won't be able to push code or run a successful build and deploy that code to production.</p>
						<p>Let the bots tell people off… rather than your team mates.</p>

					<h2>React told me off</h2>
					<p>
						...but not all the time
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>As you can see, React, React Testing Library, and other accessibility linting tools are trying to improve accessibility in several ways:</p>
						<ol>
							<li><p>It tries to change the way you approach writing tests. To think more along the lines of what users do on the page, and querying accessible names or roles to check if something works as expected</p></li>
							<li><p>It tries to embed basic accessibility as a part of the development process or deployment pipeline</p></li>
							<li><p>It tries to nudge you to add important things like alt tags to images, and accessible names in links and buttons.</p></li>
						</ol>
						<p>It will tell me off, if my element doesn't have an accessible name. But robots don't understand what the 'most usable' accessible name looks like. </p>
						<p>If I wasn't an UX conscious engineer, I may have fixed the issue by putting a random text in as an element's accessible name and calling it the day.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Bots don't know UX</h2>
					<p>
						Good HTML &amp; copy...<br>We need humans for that
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>People can't properly address low-hanging issues raised by tooling, without understanding why that was considered an issue.</p>
						<p>They need to understand HTML, yes, but also how copy design fits into the whole experience.</p>
						<p>Copy is a core part of good UX. It's crucial for assistive technologies.</p>
						<p>And as of now, bots hasn't gotten smart enough, to be the judge of what a good copy looks like yet.</p>
						<p>It can't tell if your tab order is all messed up either.</p>
						<hr>
						<p>Another problem, is that new team members who weren't involved in the automated tests and linting tool setup, <br>may incorrectly assume that's it. You're accessible if all tests passed.</p>
						<p>Team needs to create an embeded culture of making things accessible in all part of the process, from research, to design, to criteria writing, to testing to prevent that misunderstanding.</p>
						<p>So yes, React could tell me off for writing some inaccessible code.</p>
						<p>But we still have to rely on human coders, testers, and designers to figure out what makes sense for our UI.</p>
